Tests on the zify tactic

- `abstract_integer_type.v`: first tests on an abstract integer type (addition, equality);
- `ssrint_type.v`: tests on the `ssrint` type;
- `ring_operations.v`: tests with the ring notations and generic operations;
- `smtcoq_after_zify.v`: copies of some outputs of `zify` given to the SMTCoq `smt` tactic, to check whether the goals can be solved easily.
